# Contributing to Windows Builder

Thanks for helping. Windows Builder is part of OpenShift Community Tools (OCT), a
community project that is not officially supported by Red Hat. Bug fixes, new
options and docs improvements are all welcome. For larger changes, open an
issue first so we can agree on the approach before you spend time on it.

## Setup

Requirements: Node.js 20 and Corepack (it provides the Yarn version pinned in
`package.json`) and Go (version in `builder/go.mod`) for the companion service.

```bash
corepack enable
yarn install
yarn verify    # type check, translation keys, repository rules, production build
```

For `builder/`:

```bash
cd builder && go vet ./... && go test ./...
```

The same checks run in GitHub Actions on every pull request. A pull request
can be merged when they pass and a maintainer has reviewed it.

## Test on your own cluster

Use a lab cluster you can afford to break.

Build your image and push it to a registry you own (make the repository public,
or add a pull secret):

```bash
podman build -t quay.io/<you>/oct-windows-builder:dev -f Containerfile .
podman push quay.io/<you>/oct-windows-builder:dev
```

**If Windows Builder is already installed from the storefront**, swap in your image:

```bash
oc set image deploy/oct-windows-builder -n oct-windows-builder plugin=quay.io/<you>/oct-windows-builder:dev
```

**Otherwise** deploy the YAML in this repo with your image:

```bash
sed 's|quay.io/cjanisze/oct-windows-builder:[^ ]*|quay.io/<you>/oct-windows-builder:dev|' deploy/install.yaml | oc apply -f -
```

and enable the plugin in the console (skip if the storefront already enabled it):

```bash
oc patch console.operator cluster --type=json \
  -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/plugins/-","value":"oct-windows-builder"}]'
```

The page is at **Community Tools → Compute → Windows Builder** (`/community-tools/compute/windows-builder`). After pushing a new `:dev`
image, restart the plugin pod (`oc rollout restart deploy/oct-windows-builder -n oct-windows-builder`)
and reload the console.

**Builder service (`oct-windows-builder-builder`)** (`builder/`): build it with
`podman build -t quay.io/<you>/oct-windows-builder-builder:dev -f builder/Containerfile builder/` and push it. It runs as Deployment `windows-builder`: `oc set image deploy/windows-builder -n oct-windows-builder windows-builder=quay.io/<you>/oct-windows-builder-builder:dev`.

Not able to test on a cluster? Say so in the pull request and describe what you
checked instead (for example the page's YAML preview, or output of the functions
you changed). A maintainer tests it before the release.

## Rules

- **PatternFly 6** components only. Do not import PatternFly CSS; the console provides it.
- **Translations:** every UI string goes through `t('...')` and has an entry in
  `locales/en/plugin__oct-windows-builder.json`. `yarn check-i18n --fix` adds missing ones.
- **No environment-specific values:** no hostnames, IPs, VLAN IDs, NIC names,
  StorageClasses, cluster URLs or tokens in code or docs. Read live cluster state
  and let the user choose.
- The builder ServiceAccount has only the permissions listed under **Builder RBAC** in AGENTS.md. Never give it cluster-admin, and keep new permissions as narrow as possible.
- Windows ISOs and product keys come from the user. Never commit ISO URLs, keys or credentials, and never log product keys.
- **Wording:** this is a community project; do not describe it as official Red Hat software.
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) describes the design in detail. It is also the guide
  for AI coding assistants, which are welcome; please review what they produce.

## Releases (maintainers)

Leave these to the maintainers. Do not change them in a pull request:

- the version in `package.json` (both places), README, AGENTS.md and the deploy YAML
- container images (`<version>-ocp4.22` and `-ocp4.21`, including the companion image; published tags are never overwritten)
- git tags and the storefront catalog rows
